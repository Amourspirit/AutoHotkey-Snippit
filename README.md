**Plugins may contain three flavors.**

* Hotkeys - These are Actions that are taken when a specified hot key is pressed such as Ctrl+Win+A , 
* HotStrings - These are the Actions taken when a keyboard sequence is pressed such as sayhello and are often use to create text replacements for such things as auto correct.
* Includes - These are custom Actions that can be anything supported by the AutoHotkey Scripting language including custom Hotkeys and HotStrings.
